Guidelines and tips for developers in the Mind Music Machine Lab

## Repositories
If possible, put your code on GitHub in the trimlab organization account. Include a README and a license (see relevant sections for details). Preference is for public repos, but private repos may be considered. The lab has unlimited, free private repos. 

There may be times you are using proprietary code or collaborating with researchers that don't open source their code. Discuss the individual situation with Philart to decide how to handle the code. 

Please name your repository in the style Device-BriefProjectName. If the code uses multiple devices or no specific device, just use BriefProjectName. Try to be descriptive enough that someone browsing the list of repos will know what the project is about at a glance. 

## README
Please start all projects with a README written in Markdown that includes the project name, the names of developers involved, and a description of the project. As the project is coded and finished, please add instructions for use and enough implementation and installation details to get a new developer started. If your program has any quirks, make sure to document them. 

When writing your README, keep in mind that people may be looking at your project several years after it was coded and long after you've graduated. Try to balance writing enough detail to satisfy someone taking over the project and keeping the documentation easy to maintain.

## Comments
Comment your code. No need to go crazy, but try to be helpful to whoever inherits your code down the line.

## Licensing
By default, we use the GNU General Public License (GPLv3) license (see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html for further details). However, licensing can get complicated. You'll need to take into account any of the requirements imposed by programs you use as some may impose licensing restrictions (i.e., they must be shared under the same license as the original or something similar). 

## Privacy and Compliance
At no time should any personally identifiable information or IRB restricted data be posted publicly or stored on third party servers (i.e., on GitHub). It's recommended that, when feasible, such data not be hard coded at all.
